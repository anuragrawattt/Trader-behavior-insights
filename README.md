# Overview
This project analyzes trader behavior across different market sentiments using daily trading metrics and Fear & Greed sentiment data.  
It is divided into three parts: **Data Prep (Part A)**, **Analysis (Part B)**, and **Actionable Strategies (Part C)**.

⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anuragrawattt/Trader-behavior-insights.git
cd Trader-behavior-insights
```

How to Run
Part A — Data Preparation
Open notebooks/PartA.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
This notebook cleans raw trades, handles duplicates, and generates daily metrics.

Part B — Sentiment Analysis
Run notebooks/PART-B.ipynb.
This merges metrics with sentiment data, compares performance across sentiment categories, and generates charts/tables.
Outputs are saved automatically into:
- outputs/charts/ (PNG plots)
- outputs/tables/ (CSV summaries)

Part C — Actionable Strategies
Open notebooks/PART-C.ipynb.
This notebook contains written insights and rules of thumb based on the analysis.
No code is required — just strategic recommendations.

## 📊 Deliverables
List charts, tables, and insights.

## 📄 Summary

### Methodology
- Collected raw trading metrics (`daily_metrics.csv`) and sentiment data (`fear_greedupdated.csv`).
- Cleaned and standardized timestamps, handled duplicates, and ensured consistent formats.
- Merged datasets by date to align trader performance with sentiment classification.
- Aggregated metrics by sentiment categories (Extreme Fear, Fear, Neutral, Greed, Extreme Greed).
- Segmented traders by leverage, trade frequency, and consistency to identify behavioral patterns.
- Visualized results with bar plots and box plots, and exported summary tables for reproducibility.

### Insights
- **PnL & Win Rate:** Performance weakens during Fear days, while Greed days show slightly stronger outcomes.
- **Leverage:** Traders tend to use higher leverage in Greed conditions, amplifying both gains and risks.
- **Position Sizes:** USD exposure shrinks in Fear, but token counts don’t always shrink proportionally — hidden risk.
- **Bias:** Long positions dominate in Greed, shorts dominate in Fear, showing herd‑driven sentiment shifts.
- **Trader Segments:** Frequent traders smooth volatility better than infrequent ones; consistent traders outperform inconsistent ones.
## Performance on Fear vs Greed Days
Insights
- If PnL is lower on Fear days, it suggests traders struggle in risk‑off sentiment.
- If Win Rate drops on Fear days, it shows more losing trades.
- If Leverage is higher on Greed days, traders are more aggressive when sentiment is positive.

## Behavior Changes Based on Sentiment
Insights
- If trade frequency is higher on Greed days, traders chase opportunities.
- If long/short ratio shifts, it shows bias (e.g., more longs on Greed days).
- Larger Size USD on Greed days = traders risk more when confident.

### Strategy Recommendations
1. **Dynamic Position Scaling:** On Fear days, scale positions by token count rather than USD value to avoid hidden overexposure.  
2. **Bias‑Triggered Trade Caps:** When long/short bias exceeds 70%, cap trades in the dominant direction to prevent herd‑driven over‑concentration.
